A comprehensive WordPress migration tool that enables seamless database, media, and file synchronization between WordPress environments.

== Description ==

WP Migrate is a powerful WordPress plugin that automates the complex process of migrating WordPress sites between different environments. Whether you're moving from local to production, setting up staging environments, or synchronizing content between multiple sites, WP Migrate provides the tools you need.

* **Content Synchronization**: Keep multiple environments in sync
* **Site Migrations**: Move WordPress sites between hosting providers
* **Backup and Recovery**: Create and restore comprehensive backups

= WordPress Serialized Data Handling =

One of the biggest challenges in WordPress migrations is handling serialized data. WordPress stores many settings, widget configurations, and custom field values as PHP serialized data. Standard find-and-replace operations can corrupt this data, causing broken widgets, lost settings, and site malfunctions.

WP Migrate includes advanced serialized data processing that:
* Safely unserializes and reserializes data during URL replacement
* Maintains data integrity for widgets, customizer settings, and theme options
* Handles nested arrays and complex data structures
* Validates and repairs corrupted serialized data

= Developer Features =

* **WordPress Hooks**: Extensive action and filter hooks for customization
* **REST API**: Complete API for programmatic access
* **Database Schema**: Clean database design with proper indexing
* **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error reporting and recovery
* **Logging System**: Detailed logging for debugging and monitoring

= Requirements =

* WordPress 5.0 or higher
* PHP 7.4 or higher
* MySQL 5.6 or higher
* Required extensions: json, mysqli, zip, curl
* Recommended: 512MB+ memory for large sites

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is WP Migrate safe to use on production sites? =

Yes, WP Migrate includes comprehensive safety features:
* Automatic backups before all operations
* Safe handling of WordPress serialized data
* Connection testing before migrations
* Error recovery and rollback capabilities
* Detailed logging for monitoring

However, we always recommend testing on staging environments first.

= How does WP Migrate handle large databases? =

WP Migrate uses chunked processing to handle large databases efficiently:
* Processes data in configurable chunks (default 1000 rows)
* Memory-efficient operations prevent timeouts
* Progress tracking for long-running operations
* Resumable operations if interrupted

= Can I migrate only specific parts of my site? =

Yes, WP Migrate offers granular control:
* Database: Select specific tables or exclude tables
* Media: Filter by date range, file type, or size
* Files: Choose specific themes, plugins, or directories
* Selective synchronization options

= Does WP Migrate work with multisite networks? =

Yes, WP Migrate has comprehensive multisite support:
* Export entire networks or individual subsites
* Convert subsites to standalone sites
* Import single sites into multisite networks
* Preserve user roles and permissions across sites

= How do I set up connections between sites? =

Connections can be set up through the WordPress admin or WP-CLI:

WordPress Admin:
1. Go to WP Migrate > Connections
2. Click "Add New Connection"
3. Enter site URL and API key
4. Test the connection

WP-CLI:
`wp migrate connection add production --url=https://yoursite.com --api-key=your-key`

= What happens if a migration fails? =

WP Migrate includes robust error handling:
* Automatic rollback of failed operations
* Detailed error messages and logging
* Recovery from backups created before operations
* Resume interrupted operations where possible

= Can I automate migrations with WP-CLI? =

Absolutely! WP-CLI integration includes:
* Complete feature parity with the GUI
* Scriptable commands for automation
* CI/CD pipeline integration
* Batch operations and silent mode
* Configuration file support

= How does URL replacement work with serialized data? =

WP Migrate safely processes WordPress serialized data:
* Unserializes data before performing replacements
* Updates string lengths to maintain data integrity
* Handles nested arrays and complex structures
* Validates and repairs corrupted data

This prevents the common issue of broken widgets and settings after migrations.
